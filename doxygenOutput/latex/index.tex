\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First Clone the git repository
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item this can be found at \href{https://github.com/BenRobotics101/ComputerGraphics}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Ben\+Robotics101/\+Computer\+Graphics}}
\item or in linux can be cloned by running {\ttfamily git clone \href{https://github.com/BenRobotics101/ComputerGraphics.git}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Ben\+Robotics101/\+Computer\+Graphics.\+git}}}
\item you can run {\ttfamily git checkout main} to make sure you are in the main branch.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the working directory is the root of the repository.
\item Run {\ttfamily make}.
\item The program will be {\ttfamily Project5} under the root of the repository. Run it with {\ttfamily ./\+Project5}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Old Building instructions with cmake}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The above need to be installed on the system, and their packages discoverable by cmake.

This repository uses {\ttfamily cmake} to build the project. There is a {\ttfamily buildme.\+sh} script that cleans the build directory. It then automatically runs cmake and make.

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Make sure the working directory is the root of the repository.
\item Run buildme.\+sh {\ttfamily bash buildme.\+sh}
\item This will have created a build directory. The executable is called {\ttfamily Project5} in the build directory.
\item To run, {\ttfamily cd build} and then {\ttfamily ./\+Project5}.
